# Dokku Provider

The Dokku provider allows Terraform to manage resources on a Dokku host. Dokku is a Docker-powered Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that helps you manage the deployment of your applications.

This provider enables you to manage Dokku applications and their associated services including:
- Application configuration (domains, environment variables, ports)
- Database services (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis)
- Service linking (connecting applications to databases)
